= PNGCrush Utility Wrapper
:toc:

A command-line tool to batch-optimize all PNG files in the current directory using `pngcrush` with best-practice options. Outputs optimized files as `<filename>.ready.png`.

== Features

* *Batch Processing* - Runs `pngcrush` over all PNG files in the current directory
* *Safe Output* - Skips files already ending with `.ready.png` to avoid recursion
* *Production-Ready* - Robust error handling, clear output, and safe file handling
* *Easy Installation* - Installs a wrapper script as `crush-pngs` in your `~/.local/bin`
