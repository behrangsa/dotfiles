# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# I've carefully selected these npm configuration settings, Dave.
# Each setting has been chosen with precision and purpose.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CONFIGURATION EXPLANATIONS AND OPTIONS:
#
# * loglevel=silly
#   - Purpose: Controls verbosity of npm output messages
#   - Current: 'silly' provides maximum verbosity for detailed troubleshooting
#   - Options: silent, error, warn, notice, http, timing, info, verbose, silly
#   - Note: Most verbose level, useful for deep debugging of npm issues
#
# * save-exact=true
#   - Purpose: Controls version specifier behavior when saving dependencies
#   - Current: 'true' ensures exact versions for 100% reproducible builds
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: When false, uses ^ prefix allowing automatic minor/patch updates
#
# * lockfile-version=3
#   - Purpose: Specifies format version of package-lock.json
#   - Current: Version 3 for modern Node environments
#   - Options: 1 (older), 2 (npm 7), 3 (npm 8+)
#   - Note: Version 3 supports modern npm features and improved determinism
#
# * fund=false
#   - Purpose: Controls display of funding messages
#   - Current: Disabled to avoid unnecessary maintenance messages
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Disabling eliminates funding message noise during installation
#
# * audit=false
#   - Purpose: Controls automatic security vulnerability checking
#   - Current: Disabled to avoid conflict with --global flag operations
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Setting audit=false due to conflict with --global flag (npm ls -g)
#
# * audit-level=high
#   - Purpose: Filters vulnerability reports by severity
#   - Current: Only high and critical vulnerabilities trigger alerts
#   - Options: low, moderate, high, critical
#   - Note: Reduces noise while maintaining awareness of serious issues
#
# * engine-strict=true
#   - Purpose: Enforces Node.js version compatibility
#   - Current: Strict enforcement prevents subtle compatibility issues
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Critical for maintaining consistent development environments
#
# * cache=${HOME}/.npm/cache
#   - Purpose: Defines location for npm's package cache
#   - Current: User-specific cache location
#   - Options: Any valid path with write permissions
#   - Note: Centralizes cached packages for efficient space usage
#
# * prefer-offline=true
#   - Purpose: Controls network access strategy
#   - Current: Prioritizes cached packages over network requests
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Improves installation speed and reduces network dependence
#
# * fetch-retries=5
#   - Purpose: Number of retries for failed network requests
#   - Current: Five attempts balances persistence with timely failure
#   - Options: Any positive integer
#   - Note: Improves reliability on unstable connections
#
# * fetch-retry-factor=2
#   - Purpose: Exponential backoff factor between retry attempts
#   - Current: Doubles wait time between attempts (exponential backoff)
#   - Options: Any positive number
#   - Note: Prevents overwhelming servers during intermittent issues
#
# * fetch-retry-mintimeout=10000
#   - Purpose: Minimum timeout (ms) before first retry attempt
#   - Current: 10 seconds provides reasonable initial delay
#   - Options: Any positive integer (milliseconds)
#   - Note: Balances quick recovery with server load considerations
#
# * ignore-scripts=false
#   - Purpose: Controls execution of scripts in packages
#   - Current: Allows scripts to run (required by many packages)
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Setting to true provides maximum security but breaks many packages
#
# * Registry configuration options:
#   - Purpose: Specify package registries for different scopes
#   - Current: Using default registry (commented out)
#   - Format: [@scope:]registry=url
#   - Note: Useful for private packages or internal registries
#
#
# VPN/SLOW NETWORK OPTIMIZATIONS:
#
# * cache-min=2592000000
#   - Purpose: Minimum time (in ms) before checking for new packages
#   - Current: ~30 days ensures cached packages are used when available
#   - Options: Any positive integer (milliseconds)
#   - Note: Reduces unnecessary network requests for frequently used packages
#
# * cache-max=31536000000
#   - Purpose: Maximum cache lifetime (in ms)
#   - Current: ~1 year balances cache longevity with eventual updates
#   - Options: Any positive integer (milliseconds)
#   - Note: Prevents indefinite caching while maximizing cache efficiency
#
# * cache-lock-retries=3
#   - Purpose: Number of retries to acquire cache lock
#   - Current: 3 attempts provides reasonable persistence
#   - Options: Any positive integer
#   - Note: Helps manage concurrent npm operations
#
# * cache-lock-wait=60000
#   - Purpose: Time (in ms) to wait for cache lock
#   - Current: 60 seconds balances waiting with timely failure
#   - Options: Any positive integer (milliseconds)
#   - Note: Important for multi-process npm usage
#
# * cache-lock-stale=60000
#   - Purpose: Time (in ms) before considering a cache lock stale
#   - Current: 60 seconds prevents deadlocks from crashed processes
#   - Options: Any positive integer (milliseconds)
#   - Note: Recovery mechanism for abnormal terminations
#
#
# * fetch-timeout=300000
#   - Purpose: Maximum time (ms) for individual HTTP requests
#   - Current: 5 minutes prevents premature failures on slow connections
#   - Options: Any positive integer (milliseconds)
#   - Note: Critical for large package downloads through VPN
#
# * maxsockets=5
#   - Purpose: Limits concurrent HTTP connections
#   - Current: 5 connections prevents overwhelming VPN connection
#   - Options: Any positive integer
#   - Note: Lower values improve stability on restricted bandwidth
#
# * progress=true
#   - Purpose: Controls display of progress bars
#   - Current: Enabled to provide visual feedback during installations
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Provides useful progress information
