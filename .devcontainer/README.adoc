= Development Container Configuration
:toc:

== Overview

This directory contains the configuration for a Visual Studio Code Development Container (devcontainer) designed specifically for dotfiles management and development. The devcontainer provides a consistent, isolated environment with all necessary tools pre-installed, ensuring that everyone working on this project has an identical development setup.

== Files

* `devcontainer.json` - The main configuration file that defines the development container properties, extensions, and features
* `Dockerfile` - Defines the custom Docker image used by the devcontainer
* `README.adoc` - This file, providing documentation about the devcontainer setup

== Features

The devcontainer includes:

* *Ubuntu 24.04* - Latest LTS release as the base operating system
* *Git* - Latest version with PPA support
* *GitHub CLI* - For interacting with GitHub repositories directly from the terminal
* *Docker-in-Docker* - For container management within the devcontainer
* *Oh-My-Zsh* - Enhanced shell experience with customizations
* *Development Tools* - Common utilities like curl, wget, vim, and more
* *Language Support* - Python and Node.js environments

== VS Code Extensions

The devcontainer comes pre-configured with several useful extensions:

* GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat
* GitHub Pull Request and Issues
* GitLens for advanced Git capabilities
* Prettier for code formatting
* Markdown All-in-One
* YAML support
* Docker integration
* ShellCheck and shell-format for shell script development

== Usage

To use this devcontainer:

. Ensure you have Docker and Visual Studio Code with the Remote - Containers extension installed
. Open this repository in VS Code
. When prompted, select "Reopen in Container"
. Alternatively, use the Command Palette (F1) and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"

== Customization

To customize this devcontainer:

* Modify `devcontainer.json` to add/remove features or extensions
* Update `Dockerfile` to install additional packages or modify system configuration

== Best Practices

* Keep the container as lightweight as possible
* Document any significant changes to the devcontainer configuration
* Test changes thoroughly before committing them
* Consider the impact on build time and container size when adding new features

== Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the devcontainer:

. Rebuild the devcontainer using "Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container" from the Command Palette
. Check Docker logs for errors during container build
. Verify that your Docker installation is up-to-date
. Ensure you have sufficient disk space and memory for container operations
