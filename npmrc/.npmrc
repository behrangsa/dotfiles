# ~/.npmrc
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# I've carefully selected these npm configuration settings, Dave.
# Each setting has been chosen with precision and purpose.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CONFIGURATION EXPLANATIONS AND OPTIONS:
#
# * loglevel=warn
#   - Purpose: Controls verbosity of npm output messages
#   - Current: 'warn' provides important warnings without excessive information
#   - Options: silent, error, warn, notice, http, timing, info, verbose, silly
#   - Note: Higher verbosity levels can be useful for troubleshooting
#
# * save-exact=true
#   - Purpose: Controls version specifier behavior when saving dependencies
#   - Current: 'true' ensures exact versions for 100% reproducible builds
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: When false, uses ^ prefix allowing automatic minor/patch updates
#
# * lockfile-version=3
#   - Purpose: Specifies format version of package-lock.json
#   - Current: Version 3 for modern Node environments
#   - Options: 1 (older), 2 (npm 7), 3 (npm 8+)
#   - Note: Version 3 supports modern npm features and improved determinism
#
# * fund=false
#   - Purpose: Controls display of funding messages
#   - Current: Disabled to avoid unnecessary maintenance messages
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Disabling eliminates funding message noise during installation
#
# * audit=true
#   - Purpose: Controls automatic security vulnerability checking
#   - Current: Enabled to maintain security awareness
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Critical for identifying potential security vulnerabilities
#
# * audit-level=high
#   - Purpose: Filters vulnerability reports by severity
#   - Current: Only high and critical vulnerabilities trigger alerts
#   - Options: low, moderate, high, critical
#   - Note: Reduces noise while maintaining awareness of serious issues
#
# * prefix=${HOME}/.npm-global
#   - Purpose: Defines location for global package installations
#   - Current: User-specific location that doesn't require sudo
#   - Options: Any valid path with write permissions
#   - Note: Using home directory prevents permission issues
#
# * engine-strict=true
#   - Purpose: Enforces Node.js version compatibility
#   - Current: Strict enforcement prevents subtle compatibility issues
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Critical for maintaining consistent development environments
#
# * cache=${HOME}/.npm/cache
#   - Purpose: Defines location for npm's package cache
#   - Current: User-specific cache location
#   - Options: Any valid path with write permissions
#   - Note: Centralizes cached packages for efficient space usage
#
# * prefer-offline=true
#   - Purpose: Controls network access strategy
#   - Current: Prioritizes cached packages over network requests
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Improves installation speed and reduces network dependence
#
# * cache-min=3600
#   - Purpose: Minimum time (in seconds) before checking for newer packages
#   - Current: One hour prevents excessive registry checks
#   - Options: Any positive integer (seconds)
#   - Note: Higher values improve performance but may miss recent updates
#
# * fetch-retries=5
#   - Purpose: Number of retries for failed network requests
#   - Current: Five attempts balances persistence with timely failure
#   - Options: Any positive integer
#   - Note: Improves reliability on unstable connections
#
# * fetch-retry-factor=2
#   - Purpose: Exponential backoff factor between retry attempts
#   - Current: Doubles wait time between attempts (exponential backoff)
#   - Options: Any positive number
#   - Note: Prevents overwhelming servers during intermittent issues
#
# * fetch-retry-mintimeout=10000
#   - Purpose: Minimum timeout (ms) before first retry attempt
#   - Current: 10 seconds provides reasonable initial delay
#   - Options: Any positive integer (milliseconds)
#   - Note: Balances quick recovery with server load considerations
#
# * ignore-scripts=false
#   - Purpose: Controls execution of scripts in packages
#   - Current: Allows scripts to run (required by many packages)
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Setting to true provides maximum security but breaks many packages
#
# * Registry configuration options:
#   - Purpose: Specify package registries for different scopes
#   - Current: Using default registry (commented out)
#   - Format: [@scope:]registry=url
#   - Note: Useful for private packages or internal registries
#
#
# VPN/SLOW NETWORK OPTIMIZATIONS:
#
#
# * network-timeout=60000
#   - Purpose: Maximum time (ms) before timing out network operations
#   - Current: 60 seconds accommodates slower VPN connections
#   - Options: Any positive integer (milliseconds)
#   - Note: Default is too aggressive for unstable VPN connections
#
# * fetch-timeout=300000
#   - Purpose: Maximum time (ms) for individual HTTP requests
#   - Current: 5 minutes prevents premature failures on slow connections
#   - Options: Any positive integer (milliseconds)
#   - Note: Critical for large package downloads through VPN
#
# * maxsockets=5
#   - Purpose: Limits concurrent HTTP connections
#   - Current: 5 connections prevents overwhelming VPN connection
#   - Options: Any positive integer
#   - Note: Lower values improve stability on restricted bandwidth
#
# * progress=false
#   - Purpose: Controls display of progress bars
#   - Current: Disabled to reduce terminal I/O during installations
#   - Options: true, false
#   - Note: Improves performance on limited connections
#
# * cache-min=86400
#   - Purpose: Minimum time (seconds) before checking for updates
#   - Current: 24 hours minimizes registry checks over VPN
#   - Options: Any positive integer (seconds)
#   - Note: Increased from 3600 to further reduce network dependency
