= Conky Configuration
:toc:

A customized system monitoring setup for Linux desktops using Conky. This module provides a sleek, information-rich dashboard displaying system metrics, hardware temperatures, disk usage, and network statistics.

[#features]
== Features

* *Hardware Monitoring* - Real-time display of CPU, GPU, NVMe, and ACPI temperatures
* *System Resource Tracking* - Monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, and top processes
* *Disk Information* - View disk usage statistics and I/O activity
* *Network Visualization* - Display detailed network traffic statistics with graphs
* *Clean Dark Theme* - Modern aesthetic with custom color scheme
* *Modular Design* - Separate utility scripts for gathering system information

[#installation]
== Installation

The module is installed automatically when running the main dotfiles install script:

[source,bash]
----
./install.sh
----

You can also install it standalone:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/dotfiles/conky
./install.sh
----

[#dependencies]
=== Dependencies

The configuration requires:

* Conky (system monitoring software)
* `sensors` command (from lm-sensors package)
* vnStat and vnStati (for network statistics)
* ImageMagick (for image processing)
* JetBrainsMono Nerd Font or Maple Mono NF (for best display)

[#usage]
== Usage

Once installed, Conky will start automatically with your desktop environment. If not, you can start it manually:

[source,bash]
----
conky -c ~/.conkyrc
----

To restart after making changes:

[source,bash]
----
pkill conky && conky -c ~/.conkyrc
----

[#configuration]
== Configuration

The main configuration file is `.conkyrc`. It defines:

* *Layout and appearance* - Window position, size, colors, and fonts
* *Update intervals* - How frequently information is refreshed
* *Display elements* - Which system metrics are shown and their formats

[#utility-scripts]
=== Utility Scripts

The configuration uses several helper scripts:

* `sensors.sh` - Collects and formats hardware temperature data
* `vnstati.sh` - Generates network traffic visualizations
* `vimtips.sh` - Displays Vim tips (if configured)

[#customization]
== Customization

You can customize the configuration by editing the `.conkyrc` file:

[source,bash]
----
vim ~/.conkyrc
----

[#display-sections]
=== Main Display Sections

* *Sensory Information* - Hardware temperatures and power usage
* *Process Monitor* - Shows top processes by CPU and memory usage
* *Disk Usage* - Visual display of disk space and I/O activity
* *Network Statistics* - Detailed network traffic graphs for hourly, daily, and monthly usage

[#troubleshooting]
== Troubleshooting

If the display appears incorrect:

* Ensure all dependencies are installed
* Check that the font specified in the configuration is available
* Verify that sensor commands return valid data for your hardware
* Check permissions on the utility scripts (they should be executable)

For font-related issues, modify the font specification in `.conkyrc`:

[source]
----
font = 'Maple Mono NF:size=10',
----

Replace with any system font you have installed.
