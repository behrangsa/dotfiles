= NPM Configuration Module

A meticulously crafted npm configuration module for dotfiles management, designed with precision and attention to detail.

== Overview

This module manages npm configuration through a centralized `.npmrc` file that is symlinked to the user's home directory. The configuration has been carefully optimized for reliability, security, and performance across various network conditions.

== Features

* *Symlink-based management* - Changes to the source file are immediately reflected
* *Backup protection* - Existing configurations are safely preserved
* *Optimized settings* - Carefully tuned for stability and performance
* *VPN-friendly* - Network timeouts and retry logic optimized for slower connections
* *Security-conscious* - Appropriate audit levels and script execution policies

== Installation

Run the installation script to create a symlink from `~/.npmrc` to this module's configuration:

[source,bash]
----
./install.sh
----

The script will:

1. Create a backup of any existing `~/.npmrc` file
2. Remove any existing symlinks
3. Create a new symlink pointing to this module's `.npmrc`
4. Provide detailed logging throughout the process

== Configuration Highlights

=== Core Settings

* *Exact versions* (`save-exact=true`) - Ensures reproducible builds
* *Modern lockfile* (`lockfile-version=3`) - Uses npm v8+ format
* *Engine strictness* (`engine-strict=true`) - Enforces Node.js compatibility

=== Network Optimization

* *Retry logic* - 2 retries with exponential backoff
* *Connection limits* - 5 concurrent connections maximum
* *Timeout handling* - 2-second timeout for responsive feedback

=== Security & Maintenance

* *Audit configuration* - High-level vulnerabilities only
* *Funding messages* - Disabled to reduce noise
* *Script execution* - Enabled but monitored

=== Cache Management

* *Offline preference* - Disabled for fresh package retrieval
* *Cache location* - Centralized in `${HOME}/.npm/cache`
* *Lock handling* - 2 retries with reasonable timeouts

== File Structure

----
npmrc/
├── README.adoc          # This documentation
├── install.sh           # Installation script
└── .npmrc              # NPM configuration file
----

== Backup Location

Existing `.npmrc` files are backed up to:

----
~/.dotfiles_backup/npmrc/.npmrc.backup.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors, ensure the source file has appropriate read permissions:

[source,bash]
----
chmod 644 dotfiles/npmrc/.npmrc
----

=== Symlink Verification

To verify the symlink was created correctly:

[source,bash]
----
ls -la ~/.npmrc
readlink ~/.npmrc
----

=== Configuration Testing

Test npm configuration with:

[source,bash]
----
npm config list
npm config get loglevel
----

== Customization

To modify the configuration:

1. Edit the `.npmrc` file in this directory
2. Changes will be immediately reflected via the symlink
3. No reinstallation required

== Notes

* The configuration disables npm audit by default due to conflicts with global flag operations
* VPN users will benefit from the optimized timeout and retry settings
* Progress bars are enabled for visual feedback during installations

Configured with precision and purpose for optimal npm operations.
