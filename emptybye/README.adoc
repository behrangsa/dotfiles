= EmptyBye
:toc:

A utility to find and remove empty directories efficiently.

[#overview]
== Overview

EmptyBye performs a depth-first search on a given directory to identify and remove empty directories. A directory is considered empty if it contains no files and no non-empty subdirectories.

The tool is designed to efficiently clean up file systems by removing unneeded empty directory structures, starting from the deepest levels and working upward.

[#features]
== Features

=== Core Functionality

* *Depth-First Approach* - Processes deepest directories first to properly handle nested empty directories
* *Safe Removal* - Verifies directories are empty immediately before removal to avoid race conditions
* *Chain Reaction Handling* - Automatically identifies parent directories that become empty after child removal

=== Operational Modes

* *Dry Run Mode* - Preview what would be removed without making any changes
* *Symlink Handling* - Option to follow or ignore symbolic links
* *Detailed Logging* - Comprehensive output with timing statistics
* *Permission Error Handling* - Gracefully handles permission issues with clear error messages

[#installation]
== Installation

You can install EmptyBye using the provided installation script:

[source,bash]
----
./install.sh
----

This will create a symlink in `~/.local/bin/` and make the utility available in your PATH.

[#usage]
== Usage

[source]
----
usage: emptybye.py [-h] [--dry-run] [--follow-symlinks] [--verbose] directory

Find and remove empty directories using depth-first search.

positional arguments:
  directory          The root directory to search for empty directories

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --dry-run          Show what would be removed without actually removing anything
  --follow-symlinks  Follow symbolic links when determining if directories are empty
  --verbose, -v      Enable verbose logging
