AI-powered image tagging, metadata enrichment, and smart renaming utility.

== Overview

`imgtag` analyzes images using Ollama's AI models to automatically:

1. Generate descriptive filenames based on image content
2. Create meaningful descriptions for each image
3. Extract relevant keywords/tags from the image
4. Write metadata to image files for better organization
5. Rename files based on their content
